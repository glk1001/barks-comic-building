    Titles.VICTORY_GARDEN_THE: " This was Barks's first comic-book work after leaving the Disney"
    " studio."  
    " \n\nFrom Michael Barrier:"
    " There is in the Disney Archives an undated note to Barks from the"
    ' Disney studio, signed "Dorothy" (probably Dorothy Strebe, who worked in the Disney'
    ' publications department for more than twenty years), that reads in part as follows: [i]"Here'
    " is a 10-page story for Donald Duck. Hope that you like it ... you are to stage it, of course"

    ' narration or action, please make the improvements."[/i]',

    "\n\nFrom a letter from Barks to Michael Barrier:"
    '[i]"They sent me a ready-written script to draw for story #1 several weeks after I left the'
    " studio... The script was the Crow story [WDCS 31]. I noticed some bad errors in the plot, and"
    " wrote the editor for permission to change things around. The result was they invited me to"
    " see if I could do a whole original story myself. The story of the kids and their"
    " 'rabbit foot' was my answer to the opportunity.\"[/i]",
    Titles.TOO_MANY_PETS: "In a June 9, 1968 letter to Michael Barrier, Barks wrote:"
    " [i]\"In the Sept. 1943 D.D. the story 'Too Many Pets' was a sort of collaboration. The script"
    " was started by a writer at the Disney Studio who found himself so overloaded with work on"
    " plots for the Mickey comic strips that he had to quit 'Too Many Pets.' I was handed the"
    " half-outlined plot and asked to do what I could with it. I merely polished up the other"
    " writer's gags and situations, and lengthened the tale, and lo! it didn't look too bad for"
    ' that spy-conscious era."[/i]'
    # " The Disney writer was named Merrill (something-or-other). He had"
    # " been Walt Kelly's partner in a story unit at Disneys. I understand he got fed up with gag"
    # ' writing and bought a nursery (plants and trees) and lived happily ever after."'

    "From 'www.seriesam.com:' [i]\"Western Publishing objected to the accent Barks had given the"
    " Plain Awful people and so they (for example) replaced incorrect use of 'd' with 'th'"
    ' in their dialogue."[/i] Accordingly, in this digital edition, the Southern accents have been'
    " restored to what Barks originally intended, using [i]Dis, Dat, Dey, D', De,[/i] and"

    Titles.VOODOO_HOODOO: "From 'www.seriesam.com:' [i]\"Barks originally drew 'Bombie the"
    " Zombie' with blank eyeballs. The editors at Western Publishing feared that the vacant eyes"
    ' might frighten children and so they added pupils and half-closed lids."[/i] In this digital'

    Titles.GOLDEN_FLEECING_THE: 'In a letter to Ronald O. Burnett, Barks wrote: [i]"If you read'
    " Uncle Scrooge comics, you may have noticed the story in which I had Uncle Scrooge and the"
    " ducks go to the site of ancient Colchis to find the golden fleece. A plot based on the old"
    " Jason myth. Well, I almost had to eat those 32 pages of drawings because I'd use some"
    " harpies as menaces. It seems that Harpy or Harpie is an obscure nickname for a streetwalker."
    ' I managed to save the story by renaming the old girls Larkies."[/i] Therefore, in this'
    " digital edition, 'Larkie' has been changed to 'Harpie'. (Pages 6, 7, 9, 13-16, and 18-26,"
